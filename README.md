# BAT_miner
A digispark script for automatically mining BAT cryptocurrency.
Only worth using if your electricity is free. 
This script must be flashed onto a digispark or an ATTINY85. It will make the device act as a keyboard.
The program simulates a user browsing the internet using the Brave browser. It will open tabs, scroll through webpages, and will run 24/7. Brave will show ads and as a result will generate the user crypto.

This generates an estimated amount of 0.84 BAT, or 1 USD, per day.

This was written for fun and using it is rather unethical.
